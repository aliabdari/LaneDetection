# Lane Detection of a road
detecting lanes of a road which is cpatured by an installed camera.

We use Hough transform, used in image processing for detecting different shapes like lines in images.

The most lane detection methods, which I have seen on the internet, exploit an installed camera on a car moving in street, and then they locate two lanes located on the left and right of the car.
