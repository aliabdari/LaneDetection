# LaneDetection
detecting lanes of a road which is cpatured by an installed camera.

We use hough transform in image processing for detecting different shapes like lines in images.
But the most lane detection approaches that I have seen around the internet use an installed camera on a car that moves in the street and they locate two lanes that are on the left and right side of the car.
